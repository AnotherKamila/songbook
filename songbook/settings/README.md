The settings screen. Manipulates `state.settings` (and saves it to localstorage).

TODO maybe I should generalize saving a part of (or maybe all of!) `state` into localstorage, as quite a few things should be persistent, e.g. link to home songbook. Look: https://github.com/elgerlambert/redux-localstorage
