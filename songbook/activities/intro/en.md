Welcome to my neat, mobile-friendly, and human-friendly songbook + sheet music organizer.

**TL;DR:** This is work in progress, and much is still missing. However, it is already quite usable, as you can find out by selecting "Public Songbooks" or "All public songs" from the app menu on the left.

Main Features
-------------

### Actually implemented main features

- chords and sheet music display
- transposing (both chords and sheet music)
- awesome search (work in progress, but it is already quite good)
  - it will directly show the song once it is certain enough that it knows what you mean
- nice URLs (you can just send the URL to a friend and it will work)

### Notably not-implemented-but-planned features

- adding your songs & creating your own songbooks<sup>*</sup>
- offline usage
- searching inside sub-songbooks
- syncing view across devices (when there is a lot of people, manually syncing several devices to show the same thing becomes annoying)

<sup>*</sup> If you want me to add a song, send me the sheet music or the text+chords in some reasonable format (ideally [.abc](http://abcnotation.com/) for sheet music or .txt with marked chords for text, but I can convert from some other formats, too).

When will you add support for *X*?
----------------------------------

Not before my exam period is over (i.e. middle of February). I should have some time to work on this afterwards.

You can speed up the process by submitting pull requests ;-) (The code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/songbook-web).)
